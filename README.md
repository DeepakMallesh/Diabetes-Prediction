## Installation  
To run this project, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:  
- Python  
- NumPy  
- Pandas  
- Scikit-learn  
- Matplotlib (Optional, for visualization)  

#### You can install them using pip:  
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib  
#### Clone the repository:  
git clone https://github.com/DeepakMallesh/Diabetics-Prediction.git  
cd Diabetics-Prediction  

## Usage  
Run the main script to train the model and make predictions:  
python main.py  

## Dataset  
The dataset used for this project contains various medical parameters such as blood glucose levels, insulin levels, BMI, age, and more.  
Each instance is labeled to indicate whether the individual has diabetes or not.

## Data Preprocessing  
Detailed steps for data preprocessing, including handling missing values, standardizing features, and splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.  

#### Exploratory Data Analysis  
Visualization and analysis of the dataset to gain insights and understand the distribution of data.  

## Models and Algorithms  
The models are trained using various machine learning algorithms such as Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machine.  
The dataset is split into training and testing sets. The models are trained on the training set and evaluated on the testing set.  

#### Evaluation Metrics  
Description of the metrics used to evaluate the models, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.  

## Results  
The model achieved an accuracy of X% on the test dataset. Detailed results and analysis, including confusion matrix and classification report.
